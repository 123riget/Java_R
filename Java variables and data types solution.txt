Q1.What is statically typed and dynamically typed programming language?
Ans. Statically typed:- Programming languages are referred to as "static typed", if the memory of the variable is provided at the time of compilation.

Dynamically typed: Programming languages are said to be "dynamically typed", if the memory for the variable is provided at the time of execution.

Q2.What is the variable in Java?
Ans. A variable is the name of memory allocated reserved area. It may be assumed as the name of a memory location in other words.

Q3.How to assign a value to a variable?
Ans. The value to a variable can be assigned by supplying an equal sign and a value. However a java uninitialized local variable is never given a default value by the compiler 

Type variable_name= value;

Q4.What are primitive data type ?

Q6.List the operators in Java?
Ans. Operators in java are: 1)Arithmetic operators 2)Relational operator 3)Logical operator 4)Assignment operator 5)Unary operator 6)Bitwise Operator

Q7. Explain about increment and decrement operator and give an examples?

Ans. : Increment and Decrement Operators in Java are used to increase or decrease the value by 1. For example, 
Incremental operator ++ is useful to increase the existing variable value by 1 (i = i + 1). Moreover, the decrement 
operator – – is useful to decrease or subtract the current value by 1 (i = i – 1). The syntax of both increment and 
decrement operators in Java Programming to prefix or postfix is
 Increment Operator : ++x or x++
 Decrement Operator: --x or x-
